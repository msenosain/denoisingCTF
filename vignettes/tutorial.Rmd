This tutorial will guide you through the usage of the main functions of the 
package. You can either use the function `rm_noise` to remove the noise applying 
the current trained models, or train your own models and then call them into the 
main function.

## Getting started
You will need to install the `devtools` CRAN package. All other dependencies 
will be automatically installed with the package installation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Install denoisingCTF
devtools::install_github("msenosain/denoisingCTF")
```

## Preparing your data
Before you attempt to clean your data or train your own models, your FCS files
should be previously normalized using a bead normalization software. 
Additionally, for your files to be comparable they must have the same antibody 
panel which means same number of channels with same names and descriptions.
Both can be done using the [`premessa`](https://github.com/ParkerICI/premessa) 
package (See functions [`paneleditor_GUI`](https://github.com/ParkerICI/premessa#panel-editing-and-renaming) 
and [`normalizer_GUI`](https://github.com/ParkerICI/premessa#bead-based-normalization)).


## Denoising CyTOF data

The `rm_noise` function will remove zeros, beads and debris from the FCS files in the 
current working directory using previously trained models. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
denoisingCTF::rm_noise()
```

After printing the list of column names with the index number, a first prompt 
will ask the user for the "mandatory" markers, which can be any marker that 
_should_ be expressed in the cells (e.g. post-fixation DNA intercalator). 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
files_list <- list.files(pattern='.fcs|.FCS')
smp <- flowCore::read.FCS(files_list[1], transformation = FALSE)
descrp <- smp@parameters@data$desc
smp <- data.frame(smp@exprs)
col_nms <- colnames(smp)

# Ask for channels to remove zeros
cn <- as.matrix(paste0(col_nms, '_', descrp))
print(cn)
prompt1 <- "Enter the column INDICES of the 'mandatory' markers (separated by single space only, no comas allowed)"
mand_idx <- as.numeric(strsplit(readline(prompt1), " ")[[1]])
```

Any cell/event/row that has zero expression of this marker is removed. In this example
our "mandatory" marker is Histone H3: 

* `##[52,] "Yb176Di_176Yb_His-H3"`

A second prompt will ask the user for the "optional" markers, which can 
be markers used for cell type identification. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prompt2 <- "Enter the column INDICES of the 'optional' markers (separated by single space only, no comas allowed) \n"
opt_idx <- as.numeric(strsplit(readline(prompt2), " ")[[1]])
```

Any cell/event/row that has zero expression of _all_ this markers, 
meaning that it cannot be identified as any existing cell type, 
is removed. In this example our "optional" markers are the following:

* `## [15,] "Pr141Di_141Pr_EpCAM"`
* `## [20,] "Nd145Di_145Nd_CD31"`
* `## [29,] "Sm154Di_154Sm_CD45"`
* `## [31,] "Gd156Di_156Gd_Vimentin"`
* `## [34,] "Tb159Di_159Tb_CD4"`
* `## [37,] "Dy161Di_161Dy_Cytokeratin"`
* `## [40,] "Dy164Di_164Dy_CK7"`
* `## [44,] "Er168Di_168Er_CD8"`
* `## [46,] "Yb170Di_170Yb_CD3"`
* `## [47,] "Yb171Di_171Yb_CD11b"`
* `## [49,] "Yb173Di_173Yb_CD90"`

The next prompt will ask the user for the beads channels column indices, 
and the last prompt will ask for the Gaussian parameters channels and the
intact-cells marker channel. The latter could be any marker used to 
distinguish dead cells from live cells, such as a DNA intercalator post-fixation 
(e.g. iridium) or an antibody for DNA protein (e.g. Histone H3).
This will be used as input features for the beads model and the debris 
model, respectively. Events classified as beads or debris will be removed.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
prompt <- "Enter the column INDICES of the beads channels Ce140, Eu151, Eu153, Ho165, Lu175 (separated by single space only, no comas allowed) \n"
ft_beads <- col_nms[as.numeric(strsplit(readline(prompt), " ")[[1]])]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prompt <- "Enter the column INDICES of the gaussian parameters channels 'Event_length', 'Center', 'Offset', 'Residual', 'Width' and intact-cells marker channel (separated by single space only, no comas allowed) \n"
ft_debris <- col_nms[as.numeric(strsplit(readline(prompt), " ")[[1]])]
```

Finally, this function will create a new directory called _output_ which will
contain the newly written FCS files after noise removal. Additionally,
within the output folder you will find a folder called _noiseCL_ containing
CSV files with the original data and the added columns _beads_ and _debris_
in which 0 means negative and 1 means positive for beads/noise (0 could be
interpreted as 'cells'). The user can use the CSV files to assess the 
accuracy of the classification if needed. 

See below for an example of the output's directory structure:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree()
```

## Model training
The `rm_noise` function can take new models as input in the arguments
`model_beads` and `model_debris` when `use.current.model.beads=FALSE` and 
`use.current.model.debris=FALSE`, respectively. In this section, you will see
step by step how can you build training and test data sets and train
new models.

I would advise to always train and use your own models because these may be 
sensible to bead normalization. Also, because:
* you may have a different strategy to identify debris and dead cells.
* you may have used a different set of normalization beads.

### Beads model
__1. Build training and test datasets__
You should set up your working directory to the folder that contains your
FCS files of interest. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/Documents/My_CyTOF_Files")
```

The `Beads_TrainTest` function will select a random sample from your FCS files 
(length specified in `sample_size` argument), and a promt will ask the user 
for the beads channels column indices.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
denoisingCTF::Beads_TrainTest(sample_size = 20, method = 'k_means', 
    bsample = 5000, class_col = 'BeadsSmp_ID', ...)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prompt <- "Enter the column INDICES of the beads channels (separated by single space only, no comas allowed) \n"
beads_ch <- as.numeric(strsplit(readline(prompt), " ")[[1]]) 
```

Then it will apply _arcsinh_ tranformation (cofactor=5) and perform an 
unsupervised detection of the beads using a clustering method, which can 
be either by _k-means_ or _Gaussian Mixture Models_. 
Clustering results will be evaluated and only the files in which the 
events identified as beads show a coefficient of variation (CV) <0.05 will
be selected to be part of the training and test sets. In all cases, the 
function writes a CSV file with the summary statistics, labeled 
`filename_beadsstats.csv` for a file that passed the test, or 
`filename__FAILEDbeadsstats.csv` for a file in which the clustering failed 
to identify the beads correctly.

Since CyTOF experiments usually render a large number of events (sometimes
more than a million) and we do not need that many events to train a model;
the function will take a random sample of the files for which the 
clustering was successful. This will be a balanced sample, having `bsample` 
number of events per class. If `bsample` is larger than the amount of events 
available for that class then `replacement=TRUE`. 

From the _n_ 'good' files, 0.75 will be randomly pulled for the training set
and the remaining 0.25 will be the test set (default). The proportion can be 
changed by passing the argument `s_train`, which determines the size of the 
fraction that goes into the training set (any number between 0:1).


Finally, the function writes a `.RData` file that includes:

* `train_set`: a `data.frame` with the training set.
* `test_set`: a `data.frame` with the test set.
* `train_nms`: a character vector with the names of the files used as they appear 
in `train_set`. Can be interpreted as row names of `train_set`.
* `test_nms`: a character vector with the names of the files used as they appear 
in `test_set`. Can be interpreted as row names of `test_set`.

__2. Model training__
To train the new beads model use the `TrainModel` function. You can specify which
algorithm to use in the argument `alg` (see [documentation](https://msenosain.github.io/denoisingCTF/reference/TrainTest.html)) for details). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
denoisingCTF::TrainModel(train_set, test_set, alg = 'all', class_col = 'BeadsSmp_ID', 
    seed = 40, name_0 = 'cells', name_1 = 'beads', label = 'beads',
    allowParallel = T, free_cores = 2)
```
This function will write a `.RData` file that includes:

* `model_alg`: the trained model.
* `ftimp_alg`: feature importance.
* `pred_alg`: the predicted classes for the test set.
* `conf_alg`: the confusion matrix from the test set prediction.

### Debris model
__1. Build training and test datasets__

The function `pre_gate` will preprocess the data by:

* Removing zeros (as explained above for 'mandatory' and 'optional' markers)
* Removing beads (using beads model)
* Adding a row ID column

```{r, eval = FALSE}
denoisingCTF::pre_gate(sample_size=30, model_beads=model_beads, alg_bd = 'RF')
```

The function will write new FCS files in a folder called 'toy_debris'.
The user will then use their preferred strategy to "gate out" the debris and
dead cells. Here we used [Fluidigm](http://cytoforum.stanford.edu/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=709)
recommendations and our marker for intact cells:


![__Manual gating example__](../inst/doc/figs/tutorial/tutorial_fig1.jpg){width=100%}

Once that is done, download your gated files (noise is already removed) into
a new folder inside the 'toy_debris' directory. The `post_gate` function will
compare pre- and post-gated files, label noise and generate training and test
datasets. As explained above, `bsample` is the size of the random sample to be
taken from each class. The function will write a `.RData` file with the same 
content explained above, but this time the class column will be named `GP_Noise`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
denoisingCTF::post_gate(bsample = 5000, path_pregated = '../') 
```


__2. Model training__

This is exactly the same as for the beads model training but using as training features the channels you used to gate the noise out and changing some labels:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
denoisingCTF::TrainModel(train_set, test_set, alg = 'all', class_col = 'GP_Noise', 
    seed = 40, name_0 = 'cells', name_1 = 'debris', label = 'debris', 
    allowParallel = T, free_cores = 2)
```
